# Local Multi-Agent AI Collaboration Platform

A local-first, experimental collaboration surface where humans and multiple AI agents coordinate in a shared workspace. The platform focuses on role-based orchestration (planner, reviewer, implementor) and artifact-driven workflows so conversations stay aligned to plans, tasks, and patches.

## Highlights
- Single-room orchestration with human + AI participants bootstrapped automatically.
- Provider catalog seeded with common web-UI and API adapters (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code, Gemini, Local API).
- Artifact-first workflow with plans, patches, tasks, and reviews plus task lanes to sequence work.
- Simple web shell backed by REST APIs so you can prototype orchestration flows locally.

## Quick start
1. **Prerequisites:** Java 21 and a recent version of Maven (wrapper provided).
2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
3. **Open the UI:** visit `http://localhost:8080` to see the default room, participants, and artifacts.

If you prefer a packaged artifact, build with `./mvnw clean package` and run the generated Spring Boot jar from `target/`.

## Project layout
- `src/main/java/com/localcollab/platform`: domain model, in-memory services, and Spring MVC controllers.
- `src/main/resources/templates/index.html`: lightweight web shell that lists rooms and their state.
- `src/main/resources/static/styles.css`: styling for the shell.
- `src/test/java`: space for automated tests (Spring Boot starter included).

## Core concepts
- **Rooms** – single collaborative spaces seeded with a human observer and AI planner/reviewer/implementor agents, plus starter artifacts.
- **Participants** – human or AI entries with roles that gate capabilities (planning, review, implementation, dialog).
- **Artifacts** – structured, versioned objects (plans, tasks, patches, reviews, notes) that capture progress.
- **Task lanes** – implementor-owned queues that sequence task artifacts and expose lifecycle state (active/blocked/completed).
- **Provider adapters** – per-room catalog entries describing how to talk to each AI provider (web UI vs. API, capabilities, endpoints).
- **Driver health** – tracked failure/recovery state that can pause rooms until manual intervention resumes them.

## Documentation
See [`USER_GUIDE.md`](USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on running the service, using the web shell, and exercising the REST API.
